# Linux Tutorial
**What is Linux?**
Linux is an operating system's kernel. It is a clone of UNIX, and it is free and open-source.
About 90% of the Internet is powered by Linux servers.
Linux is considered very secure, safe, and fast.
Thus most of the viruses in the world run on Windows, and not Linux.
Here are some basic commands that you can use in Linux.
- You can use the **pwd** command to know in exactly which directory you are.
  - **pwd** is helpful because it gives the exact path from the root.
