# How the internet works:

1. When you are trying to pull up a website, the browser sends a GET request to the DNS server first to get the IP address of that domain name.

**IP address** - IP(Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier for identifying each computer to communicate over a network.

**Domain name** - It is like the name of the website before the top level domains such as .com or .org. Ex) **yahoo**.com. The yahoo is the domain name.

**DNS** - Domain Name Server. This converts a domain name into an IP address or vice versa.
