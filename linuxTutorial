# Linux Tutorial
**What is Linux?**
Linux is an operating system's kernel. It is a clone of UNIX, and it is free and open-source.
About 90% of the Internet is powered by Linux servers.
Linux is considered very secure, safe, and fast.
Thus most of the viruses in the world run on Windows, and not Linux.
Here are some basic commands that you can use in Linux.
- You can use the **pwd** command to know in exactly which directory you are.
  - **pwd** is helpful because it gives the exact path from the root
- You can use the **ls** command to know what files are in the directory you are in.
  - **ls -a** is used to see all the hidden files.
- You can use the **cd** command to go to a certain directory.
  - **cd ..** is used to go back to the previous folder.
- You can use the **mkdir** and **rmdir** commands to create and delete repositories, respectively.
  - **rmdir** can only be used on empty directories. To delete a directory with files, use **rm**.
- As said before, you can use the **rm** command to delete a directory with files.
  - **rm -r** is used to delete just the directory, not the files.
